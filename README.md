## This is django project to embaded xml formatted information within existing pdf file. First create xml formatted  file and then write that xml file with the existing pdf file and generate new pdf file.

#### An XML invoice is an e-invoice sent as an XML file - a structured file format that is platformed-independent and readable by humans and machines.

Invoicing is an essential process for any business. It helps keep track of money owed and paid and records the transactions for future reference.

With the world moving from traditional paper invoices to e-invoices, you’ll come across different e-invoicing lingo. One of them is XML invoicing.

In this the project where we created an e-invoice everything you need to know about XML invoicing. We’ll discuss here what XML invoicing is, how it works, and what its benefits are.

### What is XML invoicing?
An XML invoice is an e-invoice sent as an XML file (with the invoice data stored in the tags of the file). Thus, XML invoicing is a form of e-invoicing that uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) to send and receive invoices.

An XML file is a structured file format designed to be platform-independent and readable by both machines and humans.

So, XML invoicing ensures that the data is structured and can be easily processed by computers. It also allows you to share information between different applications and systems easily.

By using XML invoicing, businesses can easily send and receive invoices electronically without worrying about compatibility issues.

### What is e-invoicing?
E-invoicing (or electronic invoicing) is the process of sending and receiving invoices electronically rather than through the mail.

There are several different methods of e-invoicing, including:

#### Structured Data Transmission (SDT)
SDT is a method of e-invoicing that uses a standardized format to send invoices between businesses. Examples include:

#### XML invoicing
EDI invoicing: EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) is a technology for exchanging business documents electronically. It is often used in supply chain management and is considered the most reliable and secure way to exchange invoice data. Some common EDI standards are EDIFACT, ANSI, and ebXML.

#### Unstructured Data Transmission (UDT)
UDT is a method of e-invoicing that uses a non-standardized format to send invoices between businesses.

The invoices are usually human-readable but not machine-readable (i.e., a computer can’t extract and process the data directly).

UDT invoicing is often less reliable and secure than SDT, as it can be difficult to exchange data between different systems. Examples include:

#### PDF invoicing: 
PDF is a common format for sending and receiving documents electronically. It is a popular choice for e-invoicing because it is easy to use and compatible.
#### Email Invoicing:
Email invoicing is the process of sending and receiving invoices via email. It is the most common, simple, and cost-effective method of e-invoicing.
Word Format: Word format is a Microsoft Word document that you can use to send and receive invoices electronically.
### Hybrid Invoice
Hybrid invoicing is a method of e-invoicing that uses a combination of different formats, such as XML and EDIFACT, or having a PDF invoice with XML data embedded into it (e.g., ZUGFeRD).

In such a case, all the invoice data in XML format must be available in PDF format.

Hybrid invoicing allows businesses to take advantage of the best features of each technology while still maintaining compatibility with other systems.

### What is the purpose of XML e-invoicing?
The purpose of XML e-invoicing is to provide a standard way for businesses to send and receive invoices electronically.

By using XML, companies can avoid the hassle of dealing with compatibility issues and can easily share invoicing data between different applications and systems.

#### Specific reasons why most businesses use XML e-invoicing include the following:

#### 1. Readability
XML is a standard format where programs can automatically read the values in the invoice fields. The program can then process the invoice, e.g., verification and other tasks.

#### 2. Compatibility
E-invoicing service providers inter-operate with other service providers. And XML is a widely used format, so most available systems are compatible with XML, making it a popular choice for businesses that need to exchange data with other parties.

#### 3. Efficiency
XML invoicing is a fast and efficient way to send and receive invoices electronically. It eliminates the need to print and mail invoices, saving your business time and money.

#### 4. Security
XML invoicing is a secure way to send and receive invoices electronically. It helps to protect against data theft and fraud and ensures that confidential information is not compromised.

#### 5. Compliance
XML invoicing is a compliant way to send and receive invoices electronically. This means that it meets the regulatory requirements for invoicing and is suitable for businesses of all sizes.
